VARSE is an Android app created by the MILE research group. The <a href="http://lia.esei.uvigo.es/lia/view/">MILE group</a>
can be reached emailing <a href="mailto:jbgarcia -at- uvigo.es">jbgarcia -at- uvigo.es</a>,
for enquiries about privacy or any other kind.
</p>
<p>
Before performing an experiment, VARSE will ask permission to access location services in the background.
This is needed to obtain a better support for Bluetooth, the kind of connection needed for health devices to communicate with.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>It is not in the aims of the MILE Group through VARSE to systematically or otherwise collect or share private data from individuals.</li>
  <li>The personal and sensible information this application has access to include:
    <ul>
      <li>In order for the application to offer its services it needs to activate location services in background,
       due to the application's design itself (bluetooth access to medical devices). Actually, no location data at all is collected.</li>
      <li>During an experiment, VARSE does only collect information about the HR (heart rate), the RR (distance between two 'R' peaks of ECG waves),
       and HRV (heart-rate variability). This is needed for the app to achieve its advertised objectives.
       With these data VARSE will be able to determine, through various calculations, the stress level of the individual
       among other advertised data which are also part of the objectives of the app.
       All this information is stored in the user's phone internal storage from where the user can retrieve
       it to obtain graphics and summary information from the experiments carried out.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>As mentioned earlier, all sensible information is stored in the phone's private storage, so no one except for the user herself can access them.
  <li>VARSE was designed for personal use only. The HR, RR and HRV data belongs to the user and the MILE group does not access it,
      store it anyhow, or claim its ownership. VARSE nor the MILE group share this information with anyone.</li>
