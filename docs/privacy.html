VARSE is an Android app created by the MILE research group. The MILE group can be reached emailing <a href="mailto:formella@uvigo.es">formella@uvigo.es</a>,
for enquiries about privacy or any other kind.
</p>
<p>
VARSE will ask permission to access location services in the background.
This is needed to obtain a better support for Bluetooth, the kind of connection needed for health devices to communicate with.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>The personal and sensible information this application has access to include:
    <ul>
      <li>In order for the application to offer its services it needs to activate location services in background,
which could lead to the obtention of personal data, this is due to the application's design and no location data at all is collected.
It is not in the aims of MILE to systematically or otherwise collect or share private data from individuals.</li>
      <li>VARSE does only collect information about the HR (heart rate), the RR (distance between two 'R' peaks of ECG waves),
and HRV (heart-rate variability). This is needed for the app to achieve its advertised objectives.
With these data VARSE will be able to determine, through various calculations, the stress level of the individual
among other advertised data which are also part of the objectives of the app.
All this information is stored in the user's phone internal storage from where the user can retrieve
        it to obtain graphics and summary information from the experiments carried out.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>As mentioned earlier, all sensible information is stored in the phone's private storage, so no one except for the user herself can access them.
  <li>VARSE was designed for personal use only.
The HR, RR and HRV data belongs to the user and the MILE group does not access it, store it anyhow, or claim its ownership.
VARSE nor the MILE group share this information with anyone.</li>
