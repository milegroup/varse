<h1>VARSE's privacy policy</h1>
<p>
<div id="dvMain">
VARSE is an Android app created by the MILE research group.
Although we are aware that in order for the application to offer its services it needs to activate location services in background,
which could lead to the obtention of personal data, this is due to the application's design and no location data at all is collected.
It is not in the aims of MILE to systematically or otherwise collect private data from individuals.
</p>
<p>VARSE does only collect information about the HR (heart rate), the RR (distance between two 'R' peaks of ECG waves),
and HRV (heart-rate variability). This is needed for the app to achieve its advertised objectives.
With these data VARSE will be able to determine, through various calculations, the stress level of the individual
among other advertised data which are also part of the objectives of the app.
All this information is stored in the user's phone internal storage from where the user can retrieve
it to obtain graphics and summary information from the experiments carried out.
</p>
<p>
That is why, in order to be able to offer these services, VARSE will ask permission to access location services in the background.
This is needed to obtain a better support for Bluetooth, the kind of connection needed for health devices to communicate with.
</p>
<p>VARSE was designed for personal use only.
The HR, RR and HRV data belongs to the user and the MILE group does not claim ownership of any kind.
VARSE nor the MILE group do NOT share this information with anyone.
