<h1>VARSE Privacy policy</h1>
<p>
<div id="dvMain">
VARSE is an Android app created by the MILE research group.
Although we are aware that in order for the application to offer its services it needs to collect important personal data,
it is not in the aims of MILE to systematically or otherwise collect private data from individuals.
</p>
<p>VARSE collects information about the HR (heart rate), the RR (distance between two 'R' peaks of ECG waves),
and HRV (heart-rate variability), in order to be able to, through various calculations, determine, among other data,
the stress level of the individual. This information is stored in the user's phone internal storage
from where the user can retrieve it to obtain graphics and summary information from the experiments carried out.
</p>
<p>
In order to be able to offer these services, VARSE will ask permission to access location services.
This is needed to obtain a better support for Bluetooth, the kind of connection needed for health devices to communicate with.
</p>
<p>VARSE was designed for personal use only.
The HR, RR and HRV data belongs to the user and the MILE group does not claim ownership of any kind.
VARSE nor the MILE group do NOT share this information with anyone.
